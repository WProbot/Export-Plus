Export Plus
===========

An improved export tool for your WordPress site.

The export tool that is built into WordPress limits how you can export your data by giving you a restrictive UI and very few options. This plugin fixes that by adding a new export page with more flexible options. By using "Export Plus" you can easily export any selection of post types filtered by author, date and status across *all* of them, not just the built-in ones.

See the plugin [screenshots](https://wordpress.org/plugins/export-plus/screenshots/) for the differences that "Export Plus" provides.

I originally subbmitted this as a [patch](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27048) to WordPress Core, but it doesn't look like it's going to be added so I decided to release it as a plugin instead.
